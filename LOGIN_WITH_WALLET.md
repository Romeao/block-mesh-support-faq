* Click `Connect Wallet`, approve the message (this is NOT a transaction).
* Enter `password`.
* Click `submit`.


On the `extension` or `CLI`, you need to use the same `password` you entered, and use the `email` we generate for you.

The `email` we generate for you is in the following format:
`wallet_YOUR_WALLET_PUBKEY_IN_LOWER_CASE@blockmesh.xyz`.

If you're unsure, go to https://wallet-helper.blockmesh.xyz/ and click `submit`.

It will fill in your `email` after you approve connection and you can copy it from the form.
